# This script works on SuperMicro X9 and X10 IPMI motherboards to control FANA Peripheral
# Zone fan speed in response to maximum hard drive temperature.

# To use this correctly, you should connect all your PWM HD fans, by splitters if necessary to the FANA header. 
# Case and Exhaust fans should then be connected to the numbered (ie CPU based) headers.  This script will then control the
# HD fans in response to the HD temp, and allow the system to control the other fans in response to the CPU temp.

# It should be set as a cron job to run on roughly a three minute interval, or alternatively
# you can set a loop_sleep value, and it will loop indefinately after loop_sleep seconds.

# you can see debug output by setting the debug_mode value to a greater value than 0. higher
# values are more detailed.

# Remember to adjust the configuration values below.

# In order for these duty cycle changes to work, you need to ensure that youâ€™ve adjusted your fan thresholds as per:

# This version was modified by myself (stux), to support systems where the HD fans are connected to
# the peripheral fan headers (ie FANA). I corrected a number of issues with reading the temperature from Seagate
# drives, as well as made the temperature configurable, corrected a few timing issues, and added the loop_seconds, max_allowed_temp and
# debug constructs

# Version History
#--------------------
# 1.x Kevin's scripts
# 2.0 stux: initial changes to support a FANA/Zone 1 based system
# 2.1 stux: added initial setting to Optimal mode. Increased delay before reset to 10 seconds. Fixed date/time logging bug


# if loop_sleep is non-zero, then we'll never exit. Its how long, in seconds, we should sleep each iteration...
